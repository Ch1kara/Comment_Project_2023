We started the year by reviewing the definitions of sine and cosine functions using right triangles and then used the unit circle to extend the domain of those functions to all real numbers. We then used transformations of the plane to prove several trigonometric identities involving sine and cosine functions. Applications included proving de Moivre's formula and finding nth roots of unity. We also proved and applied the law of sines, the law of cosines, and Heron’s area formula. The concept of inverse functions was used to study inverse trigonometric functions and to solve trigonometric equations. We were also introduced to sequences and the notion of the limit of a sequence from both an intuitive and rigorous approach.\")\n",
